# OllamaUI ü¶ô

OllamaUI is a streamlined version of the original OpenWebUI (formerly known as OllamaUI). This project is now maintained as part of the ArtyLLaMa Research Project, with the primary development continuing at [OpenWebUI.org](https://openwebui.org).

## About This Fork

This repository represents a previous version of OpenWebUI, maintained to provide a simplified user interface with essential features and reduced complexity. Our focus is on maintaining a lean, efficient, and user-friendly experience.

## Philosophy

Unlike the feature-rich approach of OpenWebUI.com, this fork is committed to maintaining a minimalist design. We believe in the power of simplicity and aim to provide a straightforward, efficient interface for interacting with Ollama models.

## Features ‚≠ê

The current version includes core functionalities such as:

- Pulling and deleting models
- Engaging in conversations with one or multiple models
- Chat import/export

We intend to keep these essential features while focusing on stability, performance, and code quality.
